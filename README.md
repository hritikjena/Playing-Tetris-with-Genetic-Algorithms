# Tetris GA

This repository implements a simple Genetic Algorithm (GA) to evolve a linear heuristic for playing Tetris.  
It includes the training process for learning weights and a greedy player that uses the trained weights.

---

## IMPORTANT FILES

### ⁠ GA_create.py ⁠  (GA Create)
Run this file to train the Genetic Algorithm and compute the *best weight values* for playing Tetris.

---

### ⁠ PlayTetrisWithGa.py ⁠  (Play Tetris with GA)
Run this file to see the *gameplay simulation* using the learned GA weights.  
It automatically loads the weights from ⁠ best_ga_weights.csv ⁠ and plays using a greedy strategy.
